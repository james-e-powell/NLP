These are refactored implementations of various neural network architectures, updated so that they all use the Keras Deep Learning library (https://keras.io). The file also contains some python helper libraries for loading data and evaluating network performance. These implementations classify email as spam/not spam, but could be adapted to other binary classification problems. You will also need Tensorflow 1.0 or later to run them. Pointers to the original implementations (where applicable) are listed below: 

A multi-layer perceptron implementation over words 
(based on https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/) 

A Convolutional Neural Network implementation over characters 
(based on https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/learn/text_classification_character_cnn.py)

A Long Short Term Memory implementation over words 
(based on binary classifier LSTM code at http://machinelearningmastery.com/sequence-classification-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/)
